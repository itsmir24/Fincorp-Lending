The corporation operates across multiple regions and caters to a diverse clientele. With a competitive market and regulatory challenges, efficient loan processing and risk management are crucial.

Business Problem

The corporation faces challenges in managing loan defaults and optimizing loan approvals. High default rates have financial implications and reduce profitability. Additionally, an inefficient loan approval process can lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of potential business to competitors.

Business Objective

The primary objectives are to:

Reduce the rate of loan defaults by improving the credit risk assessment model.
Enhance customer satisfaction by streamlining the loan approval process.
Identify key factors influencing loan outcomes and customer payment behavior to adjust policies and practices accordingly.
Data Description

Here's a breakdown of each column in the dataset and how it relates to the business context:

Loan ID: A unique identifier for each loan.
Issue Date: The date on which the loan was issued.
Loan Type: The category of loan (Personal, Auto, Home, Education, Business), which affects the risk and terms of the loan.
Loan Amount: The total amount of the loan issued.
Interest Rate (%): The interest rate charged on the loan, influences the monthly payments and the total cost of the loan to the borrower.
Term (months): The duration over which the loan will be repaid, affecting the loan's affordability and the total interest paid.
Loan Status: Current status of the loan (Approved, Rejected, Pending), indicating the outcome of the loan application.
Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Region: The geographical region of the borrower, which might influence the loan conditions and default rates due to economic factors.
Payment Status: Current payment status (Paid, Unpaid, Delinquent), is crucial for monitoring defaults and financial health.
Monthly Payment: The amount the borrower needs to pay each month, directly impacting the borrower’s payment behavior.
Customer Age Group: The age category of the customer, which might correlate with the loan amount, type, and risk profile.
Employment Status: Indicates whether the borrower is employed, self-employed, or unemployed, affecting their ability to repay the loan.
Annual Income: The yearly income of the borrower, is a critical factor in determining loan eligibility and risk.
Credit Score: A numerical expression based on a level analysis of the borrower's credit files, predictive of the likelihood to repay the loan.
Number of Dependents: Number of individuals financially reliant on the borrower, impacting their financial stability.
Previous Loan Amount: Amount of the most recent loan taken by the borrower, providing insights into the borrower’s debt history.
Previous Loan Status: Status of the borrower’s most recent loan (Paid Off, Defaulted), is important for assessing credit risk.
Housing Status: Indicates whether the borrower owns a home, rents, or lives with parents, which can affect their financial stability and creditworthiness.
Beginner Level Tasks

1. Basic Data Queries

Objective: Write basic SQL queries to select data from the loans table, such as selecting all columns for all records, and specific columns like loan amount and type.
Business Goal: Familiarize yourself with the data structure and practice basic SQL commands.
2. Sorting and Filtering Data

Objective: Apply SQL commands to sort loans by issue date and filter loans by criteria such as loan type (e.g., Personal, Home).
Business Goal: Improve data retrieval techniques to focus on specific subsets of data for analysis.
3. Aggregate Functions

Objective: Use SQL to calculate aggregates like the total number of loans, average loan amount, and the maximum and minimum loan amounts.
Business Goal: Gain insights into the loan distribution and key financial metrics.
4. Simple Joins

Objective: Perform basic joins, for example, joining the loans table with a customer table (assuming such a table exists or is created for this task) on the customer ID to retrieve combined information.
Business Goal: Understand relational data structures and practice joining tables.
5. Creating Views

Objective: Create SQL views to simplify access to frequently needed queries, such as a view for all active loans.
Business Goal: Streamline data access and make repetitive queries more efficient.
Intermediate Level Tasks

1. Complex Joins and Subqueries

Objective: Use more complex joins and subqueries to answer specific questions, like finding the average loan amount for each type of loan or identifying customers with loans in more than one category.
Business Goal: Develop deeper insights into the data through advanced SQL techniques.
2. Group By and Having Clauses

Objective: Group data by various attributes such as loan type or region, and use the HAVING clause to filter groups based on aggregate conditions, like regions with average loan amounts above a certain threshold.
Business Goal: Segment data to uncover trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions.
3. Indexed Views

Objective: Create indexed views to improve query performance on complex aggregations, particularly for large datasets.
Business Goal: Enhance the efficiency of SQL queries and reporting on large volumes of data.
4. Data Manipulation with Temporary Tables

Objective: Use temporary tables to stage data manipulation tasks, such as calculating payment schedules or aggregating customer loan histories.
Business Goal: Handle complex data processing tasks more efficiently.
5. Conditional Logic in Queries

Objective: Implement CASE statements in SQL to perform conditional logic, such as categorizing loan risk based on interest rates or repayment terms.
Business Goal: Introduce business logic directly into data queries to derive actionable insights.
Advanced Level Tasks

1. Advanced Analytical Functions

Objective: Use window functions for advanced analytics, like running totals, moving averages, or ranking loans within each category by size or interest rate.
Business Goal: Conduct sophisticated analyses to understand financial trends and customer behaviors over time.
2. Optimizing SQL Queries

Objective: Analyze and optimize SQL queries for performance, using EXPLAIN plans and adjusting indexes.
Business Goal: Ensure that data retrieval and processing are as efficient as possible, which is essential for real-time data applications.
3. Automation of Data Processes

Objective: Write stored procedures to automate common data processing tasks, such as monthly loan status updates or alerts for delinquent loans.
Business Goal: Automate routine data operations to improve operational efficiency.
4. Integration with Other Databases

Objective: Set up SQL scripts to import or export data from/to other databases or formats, integrating SQL database operations with other business systems.
Business Goal: Facilitate data exchange and synchronization across business platforms, enhancing data coherence.
5. Security and Permissions

Objective: Implement security measures in SQL, including managing user permissions and roles, and securing sensitive data through encryption or secure access paths.
Business Goal: Protect sensitive financial data and comply with data security regulations.
